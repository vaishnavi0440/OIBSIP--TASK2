            <ul id="BIOGRAPHY">
                <li>Bhagat Singh's biography covers his upbringing in Punjab, his involvement 
                    with revolutionary groups throughout his teenage years, and the significant 
                    impact he had on India's struggle for independence. It details his trial when he
                     was charged with the murder of John P. Saunders, a British police officer, as
                      well as his life in prison leading up to his execution at Lahore jail when he 
                      was 23 years old. Throughout it all, Bhagat Singh remained strong in defense 
                      of Indian independence even in the face of great adversity.</li>

                      <ul id="HISTORY">    
                <li>One of the most important revolutionaries in the Indian Nationalist Movement
                     is Bhagat Singh. On September 28, 1907, Kishan Singh and Vidyavati gave birth 
                     to Bhagat Singh in Banga, Lyallpur District (now Pakistan). When he was born,
                      his uncles Ajit and Swaran Singh, as well as his father Kishan Singh, were all
                       imprisoned for protesting the 1906 Colonization Bill. Being raised in a 
                       politically conscious household where his family supported the Ghadar party,
                        young Bhagat Singh developed a sense of patriotism.
                     Bhagat Singh started supporting Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement at a
                      very young age. Bhagat Singh openly resisted the British and carried out 
                      Gandhi’s request by setting fire to publications that were sponsored by the 
                     government. In fact, he quit school altogether to enrol in Lahore’s National
                      College.... Read more at: https://www.studyiq.com/articles/bhagat-singh/</li>
                      <p id="description">Revolutionary Activities</p>
                      <ul id="Revolutionary Activities">  
                <li>Bhagat Singh’s early actions consisted primarily of penning critical articles 
                    against the British government and printing and distributing leaflets explaining
                     the fundamentals of a violent insurrection with the goal of overthrowing the 
                     government. To protest the Simon Commission’s arrival, Lala Lajpat Rai led an 
                     all-parties parade that marched toward the Lahore train station on October 30, 
                     1928.To stop the protesters from moving forward, the police used a violent 
                     lathi charge. The revolutionaries were not able to recognize J.P. Saunders who
                      was Assistant Superintendent of Police, they thought that he was a Scott and 
                      killed him instead.  Bhagat Singh quickly left Lahore in order to avoid
                       getting caught. To avoid being recognized, he shaved his beard and cut his 
                       hair, violating the core values of Sikhism</li>
